	<p>Take 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1 cup of milk, and cook together until smooth; then 
	add 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 scant teaspoon of mustard, and 6 tablespoons of 
	grated cheese. Stir over the fire for one minute, then remove, and add salt and 
	cayenne pepper, and the lightly beaten yolks of 2 eggs; afterwards stir in with a fork 
	the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour into ramekin dishes, and bake for 
	fifteen minutes in a moderate oven, or cook and serve in a baking dish.</p>
