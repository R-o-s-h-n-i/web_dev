	<p>Soak 1 cup of bread crumbs for two or three minutes in 2 cups of milk, then beat in 
	the yolks of 2 eggs thoroughly beaten, and 1 cup of grated cheese, and lastly the 
	whites of the 2 eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Put into a buttered baking dish, dot the top 
	with butter, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and bake until a light brown, which will be 
	in from twenty minutes to half an hour.
