		<p>Break Â¼ of a package of macaroni into two-inch lengths, and drop it into rapidly 
		boiling salted water. Let it boil for twenty-five minutes, then drain, and arrange with 
		alternate layers of grated cheese in a buttered baking dish. Season each layer with 
		pepper and salt, and when the dish is filled pour over all 1 cup of hot milk into which 
		1 tablespoon of flour and 1 of butter have been made smooth. Cover the top with 
		crumbs and bake twenty minutes or until browned. 
		Some makers of macaroni recommend putting the macaroni in cold water for fifteen 
		minutes after boiling it, and then reheating it with seasoning, etc</p>
